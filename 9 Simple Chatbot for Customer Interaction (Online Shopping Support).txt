==============================================
      Welcome to ShopSmart Customer Support
==============================================
Type 'bye' anytime to end the chat.

You: hello
Bot: Hello! 👋 How can I assist you today?

You: I want to return my product
Bot: To initiate a return or refund, please go to 'My Orders' → 'Return Item'.

🧠 How It Works

The chatbot runs in a continuous loop (while True)

It reads user input using input()

Converts it to lowercase for easy comparison

Checks for keywords (like order, return, payment, etc.)

Responds with a pre-defined message

Exits when the user types "bye"
