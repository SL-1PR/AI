💡 Explanation

This is a classic CSP approach using backtracking:

Place a queen in a valid spot.

Recursively place queens in the next row.

If a conflict occurs → backtrack (remove the last queen and try another column).

The algorithm ensures that no two queens attack each other by checking:

The column

The left diagonal

The right diagonal
